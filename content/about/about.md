I'm a software engineer who loves nothing more than creating reliable, scalable, and secure software solutions. I've been around the tech industry block a few times, and I've worked for some pretty nifty companies in the valley.

- [Stripe](https://stripe.com) - designed and built highly-scalable systems that supported underlying infrastructure on top of AWS.

- [Fitbit](https://www.fitbit.com) - developed robust and secure middleware components that simplify day-to-day interactions with technologies like Kafka and Elasticsearch. I also got to be part of the team driving microservice architecture on top of Finagle.

When I'm not busy with the code, I love getting out and about in the beautiful state of California. You might catch me road cycling in Orange County areas, chasing KOMs on [Strava](http://strava.com), or hiking along the coast.

Oh, and in my spare time, I like to give back to the open-source community. I've contributed to projects like [Linkerd](https://github.com/linkerd), [Hub](https://github.com/github/hub), [Rubygems](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems), [Skycfg](https://github.com/stripe/skycfg), and more.

So, that's me in a nutshell. If you're curious about my skills and experience, head on over to my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/apakulov) profile.
